## Referencing Guidelines

## Quoting Text

If you copy-paste any sentence or part of sentence from the internet / book or a sentence said in audio, then you need to attribute it to the author. For example, "Tests should be coupled to the behavior of code and decoupled from the structure of code." (Kent Beck), even better add the source - i.e. the book, Twitter link, blog link, e.g. "Tests should be coupled to the behavior of code and decoupled from the structure of code." (Kent Beck, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/1182714083230904320)). Another example is "Integration tests cover controllers, while unit tests cover the domain model and algorithms." (Vladimir Khorkikov, [Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Unit-Testing-Principles-Practices-Patterns-ebook/dp/B09782L692)).

This is important for the following reasons:

- Firstly, we avoid copyright infringement. Anything that was published by anyone in written/audio/video format (e.g. book, video, blog, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube) belongs to that author. We have to reference anything that was copy-pasted.
- Secondly, we also provide readers with credible source - i.e. we didn't invent something, but go and see author XYZ who came up with the concept

## Referencing Ideas

From a legal perspective, ideas themselves are NOT copyrighted, only the expression of ideas is copyrighted - this is referred to as the idea/expression dichotomy. So for example, the idea of TDD is NOT copyrighted (similarly other ideas arebn't copyrighted either), but a particular expression of the idea (e.g. copy-pasting a sentence from some TDD book, some Unit Testing book, etc.) IS copyrighted.

For that reason:
- For any IDEAS, you are not legally obligated to reference the source because ideas aren't owned. So for example, when I write about the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle and describe in my own words that cycle, then that's fine. It is however, _useful_ for me to reference the source of who invented the idea where possible, even though I am not legally obligated to do so.
- For EXPRESSION of ideas, you are legally obligated to reference the source because the expression IS under copyright of the original author. See section "Quoting Text"
